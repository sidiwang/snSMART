\title{Sample size calculation for snSMART with 3 active treatments and a binary outcome}
\usage{
sample_size(pi, beta1, beta0, coverage, power, mu, n, verbose = FALSE)

\method{summary}{sample_size}(object, ...)

\method{print}{summary.sample_size}(x, ...)

\method{print}{sample_size}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pi}{a vector with 3 values (\code{piA}, \code{piB}, \code{piC}). \code{piA} is the the response
rate (ranges from 0.01 to 0.99) for treatment A, \code{piB} is the response rate
(ranges from 0.01 to 0.99) for treatment B, \code{piC} is the response rate (ranges
from 0.01 to 0.99) for treatment C}

\item{beta1}{the linkage parameter (ranges from 1.00 to 1/largest response rate)
for first stage responders. (A smaller value leads to more conservative sample
size calculation because two stages are less correlated)}

\item{beta0}{the linkage parameter (ranges from 0.01 to 0.99) for first stage
non-responders. A larger value leads to a more conservative sample size calculation
because two stages are less correlated}

\item{coverage}{the coverage rate (ranges from 0.01 to 0.99) for the posterior
difference of top two treatments}

\item{power}{the probability (ranges from 0.01 to 0.99) for identify the best treatment}

\item{mu}{a vector with 3 values (\code{muA}, \code{muB}, \code{muC}). \code{muA} is the prior mean
(ranges from 0.01 to 0.99) for treatment A, \code{muB} is the prior mean (ranges from
0.01 to 0.99) for treatment B, \code{muC} is the prior mean (ranges from 0.01 to 0.99)
for treatment C}

\item{n}{a vector with 3 values (\code{nA}, \code{nB}, \code{nC}). \code{nA} is the prior sample size
(larger than 0) for treatment A. \code{nB} is the prior sample size (larger than 0)
for treatment B. \code{nC} is the prior sample size (larger than 0) for treatment C}

\item{verbose}{TRUE or FALSE. If FALSE, no function message and progress bar will be
printed.}

\item{object}{object to summarize.}

\item{...}{further arguments. Not currently used.}

\item{x}{object to print}
}
\value{
\item{final_N}{the estimated sample size per arm for this snSMART}
\item{critical_value}{ critical value based on the provided coverage value}
\item{grid_result}{for each iteration we calculate \code{l}, where \code{l} belongs to \code{{2 * (pi_(1) - pi_(2)), ..., 0.02, 0.01}}; \code{E(D)}: the mean of the posterior distribution of \code{D},
, where \code{D = pi_(1) = pi_(2)}; \code{Var(D)}: the variance of the posterior distribution of \code{D}; \code{N}: the corresponding
sample size; and \code{power}: the resulting power of this iteration}
}
\description{
conduct Bayesian sample size calculation for a snSMART design with 3 active
treatments and a binary outcome to distinguish the best treatment from the second-best
treatment using the Bayesian joint stage model.
