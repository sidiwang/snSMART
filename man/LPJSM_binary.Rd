}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataset with columns named as \code{treatment_stageI}, \code{response_stageI},
\code{treatment_stageII} and \code{response_stageII}}

\item{six}{if TRUE, will run the six beta model, if FALSE will run the two
beta model. Default is \code{six = TRUE}}

\item{DTR}{if TRUE, will also return the expected response rate and its standard
error of dynamic treatment regimens}

\item{...}{optional arguments that are passed to \code{geepack::geeglm()} function.}

\item{object}{object to print}

\item{x}{object to summarize.}
}
\value{
a \code{list} containing
\item{\code{GEE_output}}{ - original output of the GEE (geeglm) model}
\item{\code{pi_hat}}{ - estimate of response rate/treatment effect}
\item{\code{sd_pi_hat}}{ - standard error of the response rate}
\item{\code{pi_DTR_hat}}{ - expected response rate of dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs)}
\item{\code{pi_DTR_se}}{ - standard deviation of DTR estimates}
}
\description{
A joint-stage regression model (LPJSM) is a frequentist modeling approach that
incorporates the responses of both stages as repeated measurements for each subject.
Generalized estimating equations (GEE) are used to estimate the response rates of
each treatment. The marginal response rates for each DTR can also be obtained based
on the GEE results.
